"# MacroCalculator"
My own personal macro calculator for calculating macronutrients used in carb cycling diet or flex dieting.

Key Features:
    1. Terrible UI/UX.
    2. I only have to enter in the weight because it's personalized just for me. Not intended to be used by anyone else so the defaults are preset for my lifestyle. Sorry.
    3. There is one error check on the weight only with a 'super helpful' error message. Rated R.
    4. If any of the fields are left blank the app will probably crash. (Don't forget to finish filling in the form!)
    5. Total time spent on development: 2 hours. Will sell for millions if anyone wants it. Or just clone/copy the code, I don't mind.
